Verse Particles
===============

Verse clients for testing verse protocol. This application contains two programs (Verse clients). First Verse client
tries to send particle system over un-reliable network to Verse server. Second Verse client should run on same
machine as Verse server and it tries to subscribe and receive particle data from first Verse client over Verse server.

The second Verse client tries to visualize difference between received and expected partiles. The second Verse client
uses OpenGL and GLUT toolkit for real-time visualization.
